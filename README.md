#Weekly Report:
##Week One

We had issues with rendering the cells on screen, after going through some of the live coding examples we managed to fix the issue and get a cell to render.  
  
We had a problem where everything was rendering in one location, we overcame this by multiplying the location values by itself.

##Week Two

We had a problem understanding pointers, so we avoided using them. We will overcome this by attempting to use smart pointers in the future.

##Week Three
After researching shared pointers we refactored the grid class to use shared pointers of cells.

public character inheritance thing


##Week Four

We discoverd an issue where the grid class was creating nullptrs instead of cells and managed to fix the issue.

Had an issue with merge conflicts but managed to resolve it use tortoise git.
